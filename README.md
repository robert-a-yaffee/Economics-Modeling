1. Specify and estimate a model of U.S. monthly domestic auto sales, NSA (series DAUTONSA from FRED), using ONLY data for January 1967 - February 2019.  Considering trend, seasonality and other calendar effects, nonlinearity, and autoregressive dynamics (with at most six lags).

 

2. Use preferred model from part 1 to make out-of-sample point, interval, and density forecasts of DAUTONSA for March 2019. Evaluate the performance of forecasts. 

 

3. Consider possible structural change and/or non-normality and/or heteroskedasticity, and re-do the analyses of parts 1 and 2. 

 

4. Extend point, interval, and density forecasts to September 2019?
